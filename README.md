# Shakesperian-Text-Generation
I generated text using a character-based RNN. 

I worked with a dataset of Shakespeare's writing from Andrej Karpathy's The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks. Given a sequence of characters from this data, I trained a model to predict the next character in the sequence. I was able to generate longer sequences of text by calling the model repeatedly.
